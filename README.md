# MOTIVATION & DATASET

As someone who loves and spends a considerable time on watching movies, ı will analyze data about movies ı watched and liked to understand the factors and patterns that shape my movie preferences. I will be using Letterboxd for tracking viewing history and favourite movies, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and TMDB for gathering information about movies. I will download my data from Letterboxd and use TMDB API and OMDB API to get movie metadata. I aim to answers questions such as:

What genre combinations attracts me most?

Which actors/directors appears most in movies ı enjoy?

How much critical scores and award-winnings affect my preferences?
